  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>You agree that occasional unavailability of your website is not
something that can reasonably be avoided.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Nonetheless, dxw will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
your website is accessible over the internet 100% of the time, excluding
periods of planned maintenance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If despite dxw’s reasonable efforts your website is unavailable outside
of a planned maintenance period, dxw will on request refund or waive the
infrastructure fees for any period of unavailability longer than one hour.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Clause 5.3 shall not apply if the unavailability is a result of events that
are beyond dxw’s control.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From time to time, we may need to make your website unavailable in order to
carry out essential maintenance. dxw will make every reasonable effort to
give you as much notice as possible when planned unavailability will occur,
and will complete such work outside the hours of 09:00-18:00 Monday-Friday
whenever it is reasonably possible.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="enhancement-of-the-service">Enhancement of the service</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw may at any time make changes to GovPress without giving
notice. We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change
which may have an impact upon your use of GovPress.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw will not make any changes that remove or materially impair the
supply of the services described in clauses 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of this contract.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Changes made by dxw under this clause will normally have no detectable
effect on the operation of your website. If you make a reasonable request
to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
out of any change we have made to GovPress, we will make reasonable efforts
to fix the reported problem.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="support">Support</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>At any time, you may create a Support Ticket.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw will make reasonable efforts to respond to Support Tickets
within the period of time specified in our Service Level Agreement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All contact regarding the services dxw provides as part of this
contract must be made via Support Tickets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
consequent failure on our part to respond to you or to take or not take
some action will not be a breach of this contract.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
not meet the criteria for an emergency, dxw may withdraw your
ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
for a longer period as a result.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="time-allowance">Time allowance</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw’s initial fee for Managed support is calculated from the
Time Allowance, which is based on our assessment of your website’s
likely support requirements, as stated in the proposal.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw will track time spent providing the services specified in this
contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
of the time required to service your website in any given month.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, dxw will carry out all of the services provided
under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
Allowance has not been exceeded.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, if dxw chooses to complete work in excess of the
Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
completed at dxw’s absolute discretion and the fact that dxw does so on
one occasion will not imply that dxw will do so on subsequent occasions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, if dxw chooses not to complete work in excess of
the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and, subject to our availability,
will complete that work if dxw’s fees for the additional work are paid.
dxw will not charge a fee for any such work without your authorisation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
change to dxw’s fees.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this agreement
to a professional standard.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If your Time Allowance is regularly exceeded, or almost exceeded, dxw
may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
Allowance be increased.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, dxw may require
you to reduce the workload that your website generates; for example, by
submitting fewer Support Tickets or carrying out remedial development work
at your own cost.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance is calculated per month. Unused time is not carried
over and may not be used in any subsequent month.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
to managing your website that could reduce your operational costs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance will have no bearing on dxw’s provision of the
services detailed in clauses 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.1.4.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="installation-of-plugins">Installation of plugins</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>For a fee, dxw will conduct an assessment of a WordPress plugin intended
to give a broad understanding of the kinds of security problems that
plugin may have.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw may refuse to permit the use of any plugin or plugin update if our
assessment indicates that it presents unacceptable security risks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Plugin security assessments are intended only to give a broad
understanding of a plugin’s security status. The results are opinions
only. dxw neither offers any guarantee that a plugin whose assessment
produced positive results does not contain security vulnerabilities,
nor that negative results necessarily mean that a plugin does contain
security vulnerabilities.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="suspension">Suspension</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>You fail to pay invoices whose total value is greater than or equal
to our total fee for the preceding two months’ usage of GovPress;</li>
          <li>As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
protect your data or another GovPress user’s security, or to protect
other users of the internet.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the event that the services are suspended, dxw will replace your
website with a message stating that your website is down for maintenance.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>In order to resolve Support Tickets, there will occasionally be
Required Materials that you must provide.</li>
      <li>You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
practical.</li>
      <li>If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
Materials, we will suspend work on that ticket.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="quality">Quality</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>dxw will deliver work of a professional standard.</li>
      <li>dxw is insured against professional negligence to a value of £2,000,000.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of liability</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>dxw cannot guarantee perfect reliability.</li>
      <li>dxw will deliver work that is as robust and reliable as is reasonably
practical.</li>
      <li>You acknowledge that all software of non-trivial size contains bugs,
including security vulnerabilities, and that it is not reasonably
practical to deliver bug-free software.</li>
      <li>dxw will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation that you
suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any failure of
GovPress or the WordPress site that it hosts.</li>
      <li>You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
any such failure. dxw can work with you to design or implement
such measures at your request for an agreed fee.</li>
      <li>Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.</li>
      <li>
        <p>In any event, dxw’s total liability under this agreement is
limited to the lesser of:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The total fees for a year of GovPress service;</li>
          <li>The insured sum.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>dxw believe that it is best to be open.</li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw will generally not keep the details of your website confidential,
including by not limited to:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The fact that dxw has a commercial relationship with you;</li>
          <li>The nature and goals of your website;</li>
          <li>The cost to host your website.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>However, dxw do regard the following as confidential:</p>

          <li>The specific content of documents or content that will be
published on any of your websites that is not yet publicly
available, most especially the content of forthcoming
strategy or policy announcements;</li>
          <li>Personal data dxw acquires during the course of hosting your
website;</li>
          <li>The content or existence of any document you send to us that
is protectively marked.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If you have additional confidentiality requirements, you must tell
us in writing as soon as is reasonably practical.</li>

    <dl>
      <dt>Sprint</dt>
      <dd>A Sprint is dxw’s basic unit of work. A Sprint consists of
the services of a dxw team for a set period of time, and
any Surrounding Activities you require.</dd>
      <dt>Acceptance Criteria</dt>
      <dd>Acceptance Criteria are the specific characteristics of a
delivered Story which, when present, indicate that the Story
is Finished.</dd>
      <dt>Backlog</dt>
      <dd>The Backlog is a prioritised list of Stories.</dd>
      <dt>Finished</dt>
      <dd>A Story is Finished when its Acceptance Criteria have been met.</dd>
      <dt>Product</dt>
      <dd>A collection of services and software which, when operational,
will meet the goals specified in your Project Description.</dd>
      <dt>Project Description</dt>
      <dd>A Project Description is a written explanation of your Project’s
goals, the user needs you are addressing and the nature of the
work that you expect will be required to achieve those
needs and goals.</dd>
      <dt>Project</dt>
      <dd>A Project is a series of Sprints used to complete work that will
meet a specified set of goals.</dd>
      <dt>Reject, Rejected</dt>
      <dd>If you believe a Story’s implementation has not met its Acceptance
Criteria, you can Reject it, in which case, it becomes Rejected.</dd>
      <dt>Required Materials</dt>
      <dd>Required Materials are things that dxw needs in order to
complete a particular piece of work, including but not limited
to images, text content, licences, consents, or clear
instructions.</dd>
      <dt>Sprints Estimate</dt>
      <dd>The approximate number of Sprints dxw estimates will be required
to deliver a Product, as specified in the Project Description.
Generally expressed as a range; for example: “Between X and Y sprints”.
These numbers are estimates, and are not binding.</dd>
      <dt>Started</dt>
      <dd>A Story has been Started when dxw has started its implementation.</dd>
      <dt>Story</dt>
      <dd>A Story is a description of some work to be completed. In order
for Story to be considered “ready” for implementation, it must:
specify a user need; identify the user who has the need; and
describe some behaviour which, having been implemented, will meet
that need.</dd>
      <dt>Surrounding Activities</dt>
      <dd>Surrounding Activities are services other than the implementation
of Stories which dxw provides as part of a Sprint; for example: assisting
you with the definition and prioritisation of Stories at the start
of the Project, user testing and discovery, penetration testing,
research or product strategy.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="proposal">Proposal</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Before starting a Project, dxw will provide a proposal.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The proposal dxw provides will contain:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The initial Project Description;</li>
          <li>A recommendation for the duration of a Sprint, its
Surrounding Activities and the makeup of its team;</li>
          <li>Our fees, including a per-Sprint fee (based on the recommended
Sprint) and our fees for any Surrounding Activities;</li>
          <li>An indication of when dxw is available to start the work and
a Sprints Estimate;</li>
          <li>Any other information that we have agreed must be recorded
and agreed prior to the commencement of the Project.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Any Project Description that we provide will represent our best
     understanding of the work that you require to be completed as
     part of the Project, at the time it was written.</li>
      <li>At any time during a Project if the goals or user needs that your
project is addressing change substantially, you must tell us,
and a new Project Description must be agreed in writing.</li>
      <li>If the Project Description is changed during the Project, dxw may
provide a new Sprints Estimate.</li>
      <li>Neither the Project Description nor the proposal is a
specification and neither commit us to providing any particular
features or deliverables, other than the provision of Sprints.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="sprints">Sprints</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>dxw will deliver a number of Sprints in order to do work that will
meet your goals.</li>
      <li>Initially, dxw will deliver Sprints with the structure agreed in
the proposal.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may request that the length of the Sprint or
the number of developers be changed. Subject to our available
resources and your acceptance of a revised per-sprint fee,
we dxw will accommodate such requests.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of the Project, we will work with you (as a Surrounding Activity) to
define an initial set of Stories for implementation. This list
of Stories forms the Project’s Backlog.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of each Sprint, we will work with you (as a Surrounding Activity) to
prioritise the Stories in the Backlog and agree Acceptance
Criteria.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may add Stories to the Backlog.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may change the priority of Stories in the Backlog.</li>
      <li>During each Sprint, dxw will implement Stories, starting with
the most important Story in the Backlog.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of each Sprint, dxw will give an indication of
the number of Stories dxw expects to be able to complete during
the Sprint. This indication is not binding. The number of
Stories completed in each Sprint will vary.</li>
      <li>
        <p>A Story cannot be Started unless:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>It is ready (see clause 2.12);</li>
          <li>It has agreed Acceptance Criteria;</li>
          <li>All Required Materials for the Story’s implementation have
been provided to us.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After a Story has been Started:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>You may not change the Story without dxw’s prior agreement;</li>
          <li>You may instruct us to cease work on the Story;</li>
          <li>We will make reasonable efforts to complete the Story
within the Sprint.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After dxw believe a Story has been Finished:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>dxw will make it available to you for your testing and
review;</li>
          <li>You must Accept the story as soon as you are reasonably able
to do so, and in any case, no later than the end of the
Sprint;</li>
          <li>You must not Reject the Story unless it has not met its
Acceptance Criteria;</li>
          <li>If you Reject a Story, it will be returned to the Backlog for
you to prioritise;</li>
          <li>If you Reject a Story near the end of a Sprint, we may not be
able to Finish it until the next Sprint;</li>
          <li>If having tested the Story’s implementation you decide that
its functionality should be materially different from the
Acceptance Criteria, you must make a new Story describing
the changes you require, and new Acceptance Criteria must be
agreed.</li>

        <p>If you accept our proposal, dxw will provide an order summary
detailing:</p>

          <li>A total cost and cost breakdown of a Sprint and summary of
its structure;</li>
          <li>The start and end dates of all Sprints that you have told us
you would like to book immediately;</li>
          <li>A list of the Surrounding Activity you have told us you
would like us to undertake, and the associated costs;</li>
          <li>Contact details for members of dxw’s staff who you may need
to contact, including an escalation contact.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>At any time, you may request further Sprints. Subject to its
availability, dxw will make reasonable efforts to schedule
Sprints at a time that is convenient to you.</li>
      <li>Whenever further Sprints are requested, dxw will provide an
further order summary for those Sprints.</li>
      <li>Upon your acceptance of an order summary, the specified Sprints
will be booked.</li>
      <li>If you cancel a Sprint which has been booked, a cancellation fee
will immediately become payable. The cancellation fee is 50% of
the cost of the Sprint.</li>
      <li>If the number of sprints delivered reaches the maximum limit in
the Sprints Estimate and the Product falls materially short of
the standard specified in the Project Description (“Unacceptable”),
dxw will discount the cost of further sprints by 30%.</li>
      <li>As soon as the Product is no longer Unacceptable, the 30%
discount will not apply.</li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw reserves the right not to provide discounted Sprints if:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The Product is Unacceptable in part or in whole because of your
failure to “engage” (see “Engagement” below); or</li>
          <li>You have breached the terms of this agreement.</li>

    <ol>
      <li>In order to complete Stories, there will occasionally be
Required Materials that you must provide.</li>
      <li>You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
practical.</li>
      <li>If dxw does not have the Required Materials in time to start a
particular Story, we will move on to the next Story in the
Backlog. This may cause a Story not to be delivered in the
Sprint you have specified.</li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>It is essential that you fully engage with the development process in

Surrounding Activities.</li>
      <li>Wherever freelancers or contractors are used, they will work under
our direction.</li>
      <li>dxw will not outsource any Sprint or Surrounding Activity
without your prior agreement, which must not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.</li>

    <ol>
      <li>dxw will deliver work of a professional standard.</li>

vulnerabilities as is reasonably practical.</li>
      <li>dxw is insured against professional negligence to a value of
£2,000,000 (the “insured sum”). dxw is willing to negotiate
an increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to

any such failure. dxw can work with you to design or implement
such measures at your request as a Surrounding Activity.</li>
      <li>Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.</li>
      <li>
        <p>In any event, dxw’s total liability under this agreement is
