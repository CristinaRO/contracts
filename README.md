Contracts
=========

This is where we keep, version control and collaborate on improvements to our contracts. 

It is plausibly not of general interest! But if you'd care to open an issue or submit a pull request, we'll gladly look at it. And if you're running a similar business and would like to fork the repo, you're more than welcome to do so.
