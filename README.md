## Contracts

This is where we keep, version control and collaborate on improvements to our contracts. 

It is plausibly not of general interest! But if you'd care to open an issue or submit a pull request, we'll gladly look at it. And if you're running a similar business and would like to fork the repo, you're more than welcome to do so.

### Assumptions

These terms are written on the assumption that some CSS will be added to the compiled HTML. See styles.css for the details. If you don't include the styles, you won't get nice nested numbering.
