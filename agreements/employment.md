## Questions

* We vs Us vs dxw
* Are there other general duties?
* Holiday practicalities
    * Have a script which checks Forecast for work 28 days in the future and prompts people to book holiday if they want it
    * Or an email with a link to confirm that they aren't taking any?
    * Or just require 28 days notice and keep it manual?
    * Or publish holiday somewhere and alert clients or DMs automatically to absences?
    * Or push Breathe holiday into Forecast and then create some way for clients to see their project in Forecast?

## Changes so far

* Additional rights for dxw to make deductions from pay, permitting loan repayments, recovering expenses paid in error and recovering costs incurred due to negligence or dishonesty
* Commission scheme removed, as it is not used
* Probationary period increased to four months, with an option to extend for a further two
* Notice period increased for staff who have been here for more than two years
* Pension scheme added

* Holiday notice periods normalised to 7 days for a day off and 28 days for anything longer
* Indicative list of things which constitute gross misconduct
* Contract now stipulates that dxw must be reasonable when considering dismissal for long-term sick
* Staff handbook retired, "working arrangements" section of playbook replaces it

Following lawyer review:

* Hours of work amended to comply with working time regulations
* Method of calculation added on termination

* Some provisions added around conflicts of interest
* Parental leave and retirement age sections removed, as they are not required
* Lots of boilerplate additions: headings, jurisdiction, third-party rights, changes, etc

    2. You will be paid pro rata as follows: the number of days you have worked each month will be divided by the number of weekdays (Monday to Friday) in the same month, the resulting fraction will be multiplied by one twelfth of the equivalent full time annual salary to give the amount of pay you are entitled to in that month.

8. ### Fixed part-time staff
    1. If your pay is specified as being "fixed part time" then you will work for a number days per week to be agreed at the commencement of this contract.

        6. cease to be eligible to work in the United Kingdom;
        7. are guilty of any fraud or dishonesty or act in any manner which in dxw's opinion may bring you or dxw into disrepute, or which is materially adverse dxw's interests.

        1. fighting or assaulting another person or causing another person to fear violence;
        2. deliberately damaging property;
        3. deliberately or recklessly disclosing confidential information or personal data to a third party;
        4. persistent offensive, intimidating or humiliating behaviour which attempts to undermine an individual or group of employees;

    2. Other than in cases of gross misconduct, your notice period:
        1. during your probationary period is two weeks;
        2. following your probationary period up to the second anniversary of your commencement date is six weeks;
        3. after the second anniversary of your commencement date, six weeks plus an additional week for each year of service up to a maximum of 12 weeks.
    3. These periods apply to both you and dxw, irrespective of who is giving notice to whom.
    4. Notice will only be effective if given in writing.
    5. Once notice has been given (whether from you to us, or from us to you), we reserve the right, at any time after the notice was given while you are still employed with us, to give you pay in lieu of notice. This means that we will pay you, as a lump sum, the salary that would otherwise be payable to you during the unexpired portion of your notice period.

12. ### Holiday entitlement
    1. We operate a holiday year which runs from 1st July to 30th June in the following year.
    2. Leave accrues throughout the year according to the formula given below, resulting in 33 days paid leave for full time staff and a pro rata proportion for those working part time.
    3. Unless notified otherwise you will be required to take all Bank Holidays and Public Holidays as leave and those days are counted in the total of 33 days.
    4. You may carry over a maximum of five days' leave from one holiday year to the next.
    5. At any time in a leave year, your accrued leave entitlement may be calculated as follows: 2.08 x Number of days worked in the year to date / 21.75
    6. The amount of leave you may take will be the total leave accrued, rounded up to the nearest half a day, minus any leave you have already taken in the leave year.
    7. We will usually permit you to take up to five days leave in advance of it being accrued.
    8. If you wish to take leave, you must obtain approval (which will not be unreasonably withheld) and give notice of:
        1. 28 days for a period of leave longer than two days;
        2. seven days for a period of two days or less.
    9. When your employment ends:
        1. If you have accrued leave which you have not taken, you will receive a payment in lieu.
        2. If you have taken more leave than you have accrued, we will deduct an amount from any payment due from us to you on the termination of your employment or, if this is insufficient, we will require you to make up any shortfall.
        3. dxw will calculate the amount of this payment or deduction by multiplying the number of accrued or additional days of holiday by 1/260th of your salary.

13. ### Incapacity
    1. Incapacity means any sickness, injury or other medical condition which prevents the Employee from carrying out your duties.
    1. If you are absent due to incapacity, you must inform dxw by 10:00 on the day of your absence.
    2. After the conclusion of your probationary period, dxw will pay your normal salary for up to ten days of incapacity per year.
    3. Pension contributions will continue as normal while you are paid at your normal salary. If your pay during any period of incapacity absence, or if you are paid Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) only, the level of contributions made may change, depending on the Aviva pension scheme rules in force at the time.
    4. You agree to consent to medical examination (at the Company's expense) by a doctor nominated by dxw, if we so require. You agree that any report produced in connection with any such examination may be disclosed to dxw and that we may discuss the contents of the report with the relevant doctor.
