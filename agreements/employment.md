#Contract of Employment

<!--## Questions

* Should we add a section under Pay to cover deductions made by arrangement when we offer a loan or advance?
* We vs Us vs The Company
* Sickness absence requires thought
* General duties?
    * Values?
* "Staff handbook" should be recast as something which pulls specified bits of the playbook into the ambit of the contract. What should it be called?
* We need a company sick pay policy that captures our current approach (just pay people) with sufficient safeguards in case someone is long term sick in the future. We also should not be dicks.
* Gratuities/gifts
* Right to search cupboards/desks?
* DPA?
* Indemnity?

    3. We do not operate any overtime scheme nor have any arrangements for the paying of bonuses.

5. ### Variable part-time staff
    1. If your pay is specified as being *variable part time* then you will work for a number days per week to be agreed by the end of business on Wednesday of the previous week.
    2. You will be paid pro rata as follows: the number of days you have worked each month will be divided by the number of weekdays (Monday to Friday) in the same month, the resulting fraction will be multiplied by one twelfth of the equivalent full time annual salary to give the amount of pay you are entitled to in that month.

6. ### Fixed part-time staff
    1. If your pay is specified as being *fixed part time* then you will work for a number days per week to be agreed at the commencement of this contract. 
    2. You will be paid pro rata as follows: the number of days you work each week will be divided by five, the resulting fraction will be multiplied by one twelfth of the equivalent full time annual salary to give the amount of pay you are entitled to each month.

    2. If at the conclusion of your probationary period the company requires more time to assess your performance, your probationary period may be extended by a further two months.

    2. Other than in cases of gross misconduct, your notice period:
        1. during your probationary period is two weeks;
        2. following your probationary period up to the second anniversary of your commencement date is six weeks;
        3. after the second anniversary of your commencement date, six weeks plus an additional week for each year of service up to a maximum of 12 weeks.
    3. These periods apply to both you and the company, irrespective of who is giving notice to whom.
    4. Notice to quit will only be effective if given in writing, which includes by e-mail.
    5. Once notice has been given (whether from you to us, or from us to you), we reserve the right, at any time after the notice was given while you are still employed with us, to give you pay in lieu of notice. This means that we will pay you as a lump sum, the salary that would otherwise be payable to you during the unexpired portion of your notice period.

9. ### Holiday entitlement
    1. We operate a holiday year which runs from 1st July to 30th June in the following year.
    2. Leave accrues throughout the year according to the formula given below, resulting in 33 days paid holiday for full time staff and a pro rata proportion for those working part time.
    3. Unless notified otherwise you will be required to take all Bank Holidays and Public Holidays as leave and those days are counted in the total of 33 days.
    4. You may carry over a maximum of 5 days' holiday from one holiday year to the next.
    5. At any time in a leave year, your accrued leave entitlement may be calculated as follows: 2.08 x Number of days worked in the year to date / 21.75
    6. The amount of leave you may take will be the total leave accrued, rounded up to the nearest half a day, minus any leave you have already taken in the leave year.
    7. We will usually permit you to take up to 5 days leave in advance of it being accrued.
    8. You must give us notice before taking your holiday equal to 2 times the number of days of holiday you will be taking.
    9. If you leave the company, you will receive payment in lieu for any part of your holiday entitlement which has accrued but which has not been taken. Similarly, if you have taken more holiday than you have accrued, we will deduct the appropriate amount of pay from any payment due from us to you on the termination of your employment or, if this is insufficient, we will require you to make up any shortfall.
