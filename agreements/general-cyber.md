# Terms of service for security testing and consultancy

## Questions

- Are we correct to use "A or B" constructions or will those be interpreted as "A xor B"? Where the former is our intent should we say "A and/or B"

- Are we a data processor under GDPR?
- If so: add a clause saying "This is a data processing agreement", and make sure we cover:

  The Processor must have adequate information security in place;
  The Processor must not use sub Processors without consent of the Controller;
  The Processor must cooperate with the relevant Data Protection Authorities in the event of an enquiry;
  The Processor must report data breaches to the Controller without delay;
  The Processor may need to appoint a mandatory Data Protection Officer;
  The Processor must keep records of all processing activities;
  The Processor must comply with EU trans border data transfer rules ;
  The Processor must help the Controller to comply with data subjects rights;
  The Processor must assist the Data Controller in managing the consequences of data breaches;
  The Processor must delete or return all personal data at the end of the contract at the choice of the Controller; and
  The Processor must inform the Controller if the processing instructions infringe GDPR.

1. ### Parties

    1.  This agreement is between Dxw Cyber Ltd, a company registered in England and Wales under number 10984430,
        trading as "dxw cyber" ("our", "we") and the organisation or person specified on the order summary accompanying this document ("you", "your", ..TODO OTHERS?).

2. ### Definitions
    Adverse Impact
    :   An Adverse Impact is any downtime, degradation or loss of service, destruction of data, loss of
        confidentiality or other impairment of a computer hardware, software or data that occurs as a consequence of
        security testing.

    Host
    :   A Host is computer or other electronic device able to process information.

    Project
    :   TODO: not "defined set of activities" anymore...
        A Project is a defined set of activities intended to meet a specific goal.

    Required Materials
    :   Required Materials are materials that dxw cyber needs in order to complete a particular piece of work, including
        but not limited to [TODO: new list of things], consents, or clear instructions.

3. ### Orders and projects
    1.  Before starting a Project, dxw cyber will provide an order summary.

    2.  The order summary dxw cyber provides will contain:

        1.  The initial Project goals;
        2.  The expected duration of the Project;
        3.  A breakdown of the staff skills and time we will spend on meeting the goals of the Project;
        3.  A breakdown of our regular fees and any applicable one-off or up-front fees for those activities;
        4.  The commencement date for the Project.

    3. 	The initial Project goals will represent our best understanding of the outcomes of the work that you intend to
        achieve as part of the Project, at the time it was written.

    4.  At any time during the Project if the goals that the Project is addressing change substantially, you must notify
        us, and new goals must be agreed in writing.

    5.  If the goals are changed during the Project, dxw cyber may provide a new order summary. Our agreement to the
        updated goals will be contingent on your acceptance of any associated change in fees.

    6.  Any change to dxw cyber's fees during a Project will be limited to those necessary for us to commit the time
        and skills that we require in order to be able to achieve the changed goals.

    7.  The order summary is not a specification nor a commitment to produce specific deliverables. It is a commitment  
        to provide appropriately skilled staff for a defined amount of time.

    8.  dxw cyber cannot guarantee that the goals of any particular Project will be achieved.

4. ### Scope of work
    1.  Prior to the commencement of any practical security testing that may form part of the Project, the parties must
        agree in writing to a scope of work.

    2.  The scope of work will detail the Hosts against which dxw cyber is authorised to perform practical security
        testing work.

    3.  During the Project, either party may request amendments to the scope of work.

    4.  Both parties acknowledge that the prompt agreement to scope changes is necessary for the Project goals to be
        met and that unnecessary restrictions to the scope of work increase the risk that the Project goals will not be
        achieved.

5. ### Consent to practical security testing
    1.  dxw cyber may, where the necessary acts are lawful without your consent, carry out security testing, research
        and analysis relating to information or programs from, on or about any of your Hosts.

    2.  dxw cyber will not perform any practical security testing work that would otherwise be unlawful without an your
        consent in the form of an agreed scope of work.

    3.  Given an agreed scope of work containing a list of Hosts ("the hosts"), you authorise dxw cyber to:

        1. Access or modify programs and data on the hosts;
        2. Perform actions on the hosts which may impair their operation, prevent or hinder access by other users, or
           impair the operation of programs that run on them;
        3. Intercept or modify communications to and from the hosts or between any other hosts on a network to which
           one of the hosts is connected;
        4. Make false or misleading representations to your employees, and you acknowledge and agree that the sole
           intent of these statements is to make assessments of your security;
        5. Access and process personal data on the hosts, and you confirm that you have a lawful basis under the General
           Data Protection Regulations to retain and process all personal data that you hold.

    4.  At the conclusion of testing, dxw cyber will, as far as is reasonably practical, ensure each Host subjected to
        testing is restored to a state substantially similar to that in which we found it at the start of testing.

    5.  Following the end of testing, dxw cyber will destroy all data obtained from Hosts during testing, with the#
        exception of:

        1. Data that forms part of our report or any other deliverable;
        2. Hashed passwords;
        3. Any user credential compromised as part of the test;
        4. TODO: ...?

    6.  dxw cyber will take all reasonably practical steps to protect and prevent the disclosure of client data.

        [TODO think this line is the data processor stuff, if required]

6. ### General enquiries
    1.  Where your project is longer than one month in duration and involves the payment of a regular monthly invoice,
        you may contact us as necessary with enquiries or questions of a general security nature.

    2.  As far as is practical, we will give advice or comments that we hope may be of assistance at no additional cost.

    3.  This provision does not apply where the giving of advice or comments to a professional standard requires
        background research, analysis, discussion or specialist guidance.

    4.  Our ability and capacity to be able to respond to general enquiries will vary depending on our workload. We are
        not able to guarantee any particular speed of response or level of service.

        obvs this shouldn't be construeable as not allowing use in a commercial context. (IE: if we give you a note
