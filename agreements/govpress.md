        something that can reasonably be avoided.

    3.  Nonetheless, dxw will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
        your site is accessible over the internet 100% of the time.

    4.  If despite dxw's reasonable efforts your site becomes unavailable,
        dxw will refund or waive the infrastructure fees for any period of
        unavailability longer than one hour.

5. ### Enhancement of the service

    1.  dxw may at any time make changes to GovPress without giving
        notice. We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change
        which may have an impact upon your use of GovPress.

    2.  dxw will not make any changes that reduce or remove the services
        described in clause 4.3 of this contract.

    3.  If dxw makes a change to GovPress TODO BLAH - "you shouldn't care but if you do we'll sort it out unless you're being a dick"

6. ### Support

    1.  At any time, you may create a Support Ticket.

    2.  dxw will make every reasonable effort to respond to Support
        Tickets within the period of time specified in our Service Level
        Agreement, which forms part of this contract.

    3.  All contact regarding the services dxw provides as part of this
        contract must be made via Support Tickets.

    4.  You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
        Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
        consequent failure on our part to respond to you will not be
        a breach of this contract.

    5.  At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
        are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
        emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.

    6.  If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
        not meet the criteria for an emergency, dxw may withdraw your
        ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.

    7.  You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
        do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
        may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
        for a prolonged period as a result.

7. ### Time allowance

    1.  dxw's initial fee for Fully Managed support is calculated from the
        Time Allowance, which is based on our assessment of your site's
        likely support requirements, as stated in the proposal.

    2.  dxw will track time spent providing the services specified in this
        contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
        of the time required to service your site in any given month.

    3.  In any given month, dxw will carry out all of the services provided
        under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
        Allowance has not been exceeded.

    4.  In any given month, if dxw chooses to complete work in excess of the
        Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
        completed at dxw's absolute discretion and the fact that dxw does so on
        some occasion will not imply that dxw will do so on subsequent occasions.

    4.  In any given month, if dxw chooses not to complete work in excess of
        the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and can complete that work if
        additional fees are paid. dxw will not complete any such work without
        your authorisation.

    6.  The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
        change to dxw's fees.

    7.  dxw will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
        to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this
        to a professional standard.

    8.  If your Time Allowance is reguarly exceeded, or almost exceeded, dxw
        may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
        Allowance be increased.

    9.  If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, dxw may require
        you to reduce the workload that your site generates; for example, by
        submitting fewer Support Tickets.

    10. The Time Allowance is calculated per month. Unusused time in one month
        cannot be used in any subsequent month.

    10. dxw may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
        to managing your site that could reduce your operational costs.

    11. The Time Allowance will have no bearing on dxw's provision of the
        services detailed in clauses 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.1.4.

8. ### Suspension

    1.  dxw may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:

        1.  You fail to pay invoices whose value is greater than or equal
            to our fee for two average months' usage of GovPress;
        2.  As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
            protect your data or another GovPress user's information
            security, or to protect other users of the internet.

    2.  In the event that the services are suspended, dxw will replace your
        site with a message stating that your site is down for maintenance.

9. ### Fees

    1.  dxw's fees for infrastructure, as specified in your proposal,
        will be calculated every calendar month and billed in arrears.

    2.  dxw's fees for support, whether Fully Managed or Partly Managed,
        will be billed each month in arrears.

    3.  if any Surrounding Activies are being provided as part of this
        contract, they will be billed on completion, or at points as
        otherwise specified in your proposal.

    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
