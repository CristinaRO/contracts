# GovPress Terms of Service

1. ### Parties

    1.  This agreement is between The Dextrous Web Ltd, a company
        registered in England and Wales under number 6617101, trading as
        "dxw", and the organisation or person specified on the order
        summary accompanying this document.

2. ### Definitions

    Emergency Support Ticket
    :   An Emergency Support Ticket is a Support Ticket created by emailing
        support-emergency@dxw.com. Its creation will result in alerts
        being sent to members of dxw staff at any time of day or night.

    Service Usage
    :   Service Usage is the accumulated quantity of hours of computing time
        and gigabytes of data stored or transferred in a given period.

    Support Ticket
    :   A Support Ticket is a task, created by completing an online form or
        sending an email to support@dxw.com, which will be assigned to
        a member of staff at dxw for their attention or action.

    Time Allowance
    :   The Time Allowance is a quantity of time allocated for use in
        providing services under this contract.

    Overprovisioned Capacity
    :   Overprovisioned Capacity is a quantity of computing time, or any
        other resource, which is made available to your site but is in excess
        of the quantity we believe your site will require. It is allocated
        in order to reduce the risk of failure when sites are launched
        whose capcity requirements are uncertain.

3. ### Proposal

    1.  Before hosting a WordPress website, dxw will provide a proposal.
    2.  The proposal dxw provides will contain:

        1.  A description of the steps dxw has taken to make an initial
            assessment of the server capacity your site will require;
        2.  A recommendation for the number and size of the instances you
            will need, the size of your database and your initial file
            storage;
        3.  Details of Overprovisioned Capacity, if any;
        4.  A statement of the support dxw will provide: Fully Managed
            or Partly Managed;
        5.  If Fully Managed, a description of the steps dxw has taken
            to make an initial assessment of the support your site will
            require, and thus to determin an initial Time Allowance.
        6.  If Partly Managed, an explanation of what services dxw will
            and will not be providing under this contract;
        7.  A breakdown of dxw's predicted monthly fees, showing separately
            the fees for infrastructure, support, and any other services;
        8.  A breakdown of any costs to migrate your site onto GovPress,
            if applicable;
        9.  Any other information that we have agreed must be recorded
            and agreed prior to the commencement of the Project.

    3.  The proposal dxw provides will represent our best understanding
        of the hosting requirements that you have, at the time it was
        written. By accepting our proposal, you indicate that you:

        1.  Agree that our recommendations are appropriate based on the
            information available;
        2.  Understand that the fees quoted are predicions based on the
            assumptions made in the proposal;
        3.  Understand hat the total fees over the life of the contract
            may vary according to your Service Usage and your
            instructions.

4. ### The service

    1.  dxw will provide the following as part of this contract:

        1.  A hosting service which makes your site available for access
            over the internet;
        2.  Backups and backup restoration;
        3.  Storage and deployment of your site's source code;
        4.  A separate Staging Environment;
        5.  Availability monitoring and response;
        6.  Operating system and infrastructure upgrades and maintenance;
        7.  Installation of WordPress core upgrades;
        8.  A support helpdesk.

    2.  If your proposal specifies that the site we host will be Fully Managed,
        dxw will provide the following services as part of this contract, in
        addition to the services specified in clause 4.1:

        1.  Installation of WordPress plugin upgrades;
        2.  Monitoring of production logs for issues of concern;
        3.  WordPress plugin reviews;
        4.  Installation of WordPress plugins subject to the terms in section 8;
        5.  Minor modifications to theme files;
        6.  Assistance and advice on the usage of WordPress's administration area.

    3.  Unless otherwise agreed, dxw cannot under this contract provide any
        service not specified in clause 4.1 or 4.2 unless it is specified
        in the Proposal, including but not limited to:

        1.  Support for any third-party services upon which your
            service relies;
        2.  Changes to your site which constitute new functionality;
        3.  In any particular month, any of the services in clause 8
            after the Time Allowance has been exceeded.

    2.  You agree that occasional unavailability of your site is not
        something that can reasonably be avoided.

    3.  Nonetheless, dxw will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
        your site is accessible over the internet 100% of the time.

    4.  If despite dxw's reasonable efforts your site becomes unavailable,
        dxw will refund or waive the infrastructure fees for any period of
        unavailability longer than one hour.

5. ### Enhancement of the service

    1.  dxw may at any time make changes to GovPress without giving
        notice. We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change
        which may have an impact upon your use of GovPress.

    2.  dxw will not make any changes that reduce or remove the services
        described in clause 4.3 of this contract.

    3.  Francis - help? If dxw makes a change to GovPress - "you probably
        won't notice or care but if you do or something goes wrong we'll
        sort it out (unless you're being unreasonable)". Also such changes
        are generally to make things better, so hopefully welcome. TODO

6. ### Support

    1.  At any time, you may create a Support Ticket.

    2.  dxw will make every reasonable effort to respond to Support
        Tickets within the period of time specified in our Service Level
        Agreement, which forms part of this contract.

    3.  All contact regarding the services dxw provides as part of this
        contract must be made via Support Tickets.

    4.  You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
        Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
        consequent failure on our part to respond to you will not be
        a breach of this contract.

    5.  At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
        are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
        emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.

    6.  If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
        not meet the criteria for an emergency, dxw may withdraw your
        ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.

    7.  You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
        do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
        may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
        for a prolonged period as a result.

7. ### Time allowance

    1.  dxw's initial fee for Fully Managed support is calculated from the
        Time Allowance, which is based on our assessment of your site's
        likely support requirements, as stated in the proposal.

    2.  dxw will track time spent providing the services specified in this
        contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
        of the time required to service your site in any given month.

    3.  In any given month, dxw will carry out all of the services provided
        under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
        Allowance has not been exceeded.

    4.  In any given month, if dxw chooses to complete work in excess of the
        Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
        completed at dxw's absolute discretion and the fact that dxw does so on
        some occasion will not imply that dxw will do so on subsequent occasions.

    4.  In any given month, if dxw chooses not to complete work in excess of
        the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and can complete that work if
        additional fees are paid. dxw will not complete any such work without
        your authorisation.

    6.  The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
        change to dxw's fees.

    7.  dxw will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
        to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this
        to a professional standard.

    8.  If your Time Allowance is reguarly exceeded, or almost exceeded, dxw
        may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
        Allowance be increased.

    9.  If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, dxw may require
        you to reduce the workload that your site generates; for example, by
        submitting fewer Support Tickets.

    10. The Time Allowance is calculated per month. Unusused time in one month
        cannot be used in any subsequent month.

    10. dxw may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
        to managing your site that could reduce your operational costs.

    11. The Time Allowance will have no bearing on dxw's provision of the
        services detailed in clauses 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.1.4.

8. ### Installation of plugins

    1.  The terms in this section only apply to you if your site is Fully
        Managed, or if your Partly Managed service includes WordPress plugin
        updates or installation.

    2.  At any time, you may create a Support Ticket to ask us to install a
        plugin on your site.

    3.  If you ask dxw to install a plugin, we will conduct an assessment of
        that plugin intended to give a broad understanding of the kinds of
        security problems that plugin may have.

    4.  Based on a plugin's assessment, dxw may refuse to install that plugin
        or updates for that plugin.

    5.  Plugin security assessments are intended only to give a broad
        understanding of a plugin's security status. The results are opinions
        only. dxw neither offers any guarantee that a plugin whose assessment
        produced positive results does not contain security vulnerabilities,
        nor vice versa.

9. ### Suspension

    1.  dxw may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:

        1.  You fail to pay invoices whose value is greater than or equal
            to our fee for two average months' usage of GovPress;
        2.  As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
            protect your data or another GovPress user's information
            security, or to protect other users of the internet.

    2.  In the event that the services are suspended, dxw will replace your
        site with a message stating that your site is down for maintenance.

10. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to resolve Support Tickets, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
        Materials, we will suspend work on that ticket.

11. ### Quality

    1.  dxw will deliver work of a professional standard.
    2.  dxw is insured against professional negligence to a value of
        £1,000,000 (the "insured sum"). dxw would be willing to negotiate
        an increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to
        pass on any corresponding increase in the premium.

12. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  dxw cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  dxw will deliver work that is as robust and reliable as is
        reasonably practical.
    3.  You acknowledge that all software of non-trivial size contains bugs,
        including security vulnerabilities, and that it is not
        reasonably practical to deliver bug-free software.
    4.  dxw will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation
        that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any
        failure of the Product.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. dxw can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, dxw's total liability under this agreement is
        limited to the lesser of:

        1. The total cost of the Project.
        2. The insured sum.

13. ### Confidentiality

    1.  dxw believe that it is best to be open.
    2.  dxw will generally not keep the details of your site
        confidential, including by not limited to:

        1.  The fact that dxw has a commercial relationship with you;
        2.  The nature and goals of your site;
        3.  The cost to host your site.

    3.  However, dxw do regard the following as confidential:

        1.  The specific content of documents or copy that will be
            published on any of your sites that is not yet publicly
            available, most especially the content of forthcoming
            strategy or policy announcements;
        2.  Personal data dxw aquires during the course of hosting your
            site;
        3.  The content or existence of any document you send to us that
            is protectively marked.

    4.  If you have addional confidentiality requirements, you must tell
        us in writing as soon as is reasonably practical.


14. ### Intellectual property in GovPress

    1.  Francis - can you do this bit? In a nutshell: everything that is
        part of GovPress is ours (unless it's someone else's) and in any
        case, it's none of the client's business. Any time we spend doing
        anything for them that's not on their site's source code is ours. TODO

15. ### Intellectual property in your site

    1.  Francis - ditto - had a go at this and got myself into a mess. This
        should be the same as the IP section in the agency contract, except
        that we shouldn't get a licence back on anything we didn't make (eg
        when we're hosting something made by someone else). TODO


16. ### Payments

    1.  dxw's fees for infrastructure, as specified in your proposal,
        will be calculated every calendar month based on your Service Usage
        and billed in arrears.
    2.  dxw's fees for support, whether Fully Managed or Partly Managed,
        will be billed each month in arrears.
    3.  if any Surrounding Activies are being provided as part of this
        contract, they will be billed on completion, or at points as
        otherwise specified in your proposal.
    4.  Invoices are payable within 14 days.
    5.  dxw may charge interest on overdue invoices at 5% over the
        Barclay's Bank base rate.
    6.  You shall make payment by BACS transfer or (if agreed in advance with
        dxw) credit or debit card. dxw does not accept cheques.
    7.  Credit and debit card payments are subject to a 2.5% fee.
    8.  VAT (where applicable) is payable on, and in addition to, all sums due under this agreement.

17. ### Circumstances beyond our control

    1.  dxw will not be liable for any failure caused by industrial
        action or other circumstances beyond our reasonable control.

18. ### Changes to these terms

    1.  dxw may vary these terms at any time upon giving you prior
        written notice.
    2.  If any proposed change in these terms puts you at a material
        disadvantage you may send us a written objection, in which case,
        the change will not be binding on you.
    3.  Any such written objection must be sent within 14 days of the
        the notice dxw sends you.
    4.  This clause does not apply if it would violate the terms of a
        framework agreement of which this agreement forms a part.

19. ### Proper law

    1.  This agreement is governed by English law and the parties agree
        that any disputes arising from the agreement will be subject to
        the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

20. ### Email
    1.  Any reference to "in writing" includes email and excludes fax
        transmissions.

21. ### Headings

    1.  The section headings contained in this agreement are for
        reference only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
        interpretation of this agreement.

22. ### Whole agreement

    1.  With the exception of any framework agreement of which this agreement forms a part,
        this Agreement and the order summary that accompanies it constitute the entire
        agreement between us with respect to the Project, and replaces any prior oral or
        written agreement which may exist.
