1. ### Parties

    1.  This agreement is between The Dextrous Web Ltd, a company
        registered in England and Wales under number 6617101, trading as
        "dxw", and the organisation or person specified on the order
        summary accompanying this document.

2. ### Definitions

    GovSite
    :   A Software as a Service product, built and operated by dxw, which
        provides configurable WordPress-based websites.

    Service Level Agreement
    :   Service Level Agreement refers to the document available at http://dext.ly/sla,
        which sets out our responsiveness targets.


    Emergency Support Ticket
    :   An Emergency Support Ticket is a Support Ticket created when an email
        is sent to support-emergency@dxw.com. Its creation will result in alerts
        being sent to members of dxw staff at any time of day or night.

    Support Ticket
    :   A Support Ticket is a task, created by completing an online form or
        sending an email to support@dxw.com, which will be assigned to
        a member of staff at dxw for their attention or action.

3. ### The service

    1.  dxw will provide the following as part of this contract:

        1.  A working WordPress installation with a set of features as advertised
            on our website
        2.  A support helpdesk;
        3.  Backups and backup restoration;
        4.  Availability monitoring and response;
        5.  Monitoring of logs for issues of concern;
        6.  Operating system and infrastructure upgrades and maintenance;
        7.  Installation of WordPress core and plugin upgrades;
        8.  Assistance and advice on the usage of WordPress's administration area.

    2.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, dxw will not, under this
        contract, provide any service not specified in clause 3.1.

4. ### Availability

    1.  You agree that occasional unavailability of GovSite is not something that
        can reasonably be avoided.

    2.  Nonetheless, dxw will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
        GovSite is accessible over the internet 100% of the time, excluding periods
        of planned maintenance.

    3.  If despite dxw's reasonable efforts your website fails to operate outside
        of a planned maintenance period, dxw will on request refund or waive the fees
        for GovSite for any period of unavailability longer than one hour.

    4.  From time to time, we may need to make GovSite unavailable in order to
        carry out essential maintenance. dxw will make every reasonable effort to
        give you as much notice as possible when planned unavailability will occur,
        and will complete such work outside the hours of 09:00-18:00 Monday-Friday
        whenever it is reasonably possible.

5. ### Enhancement of the service

    1.  dxw may at any time make changes to GovSite without giving
        notice.

    2.  Changes made by dxw under clause 5.1 will normally have no detectable
        effect on existing features of GovSite. If you make a request
        to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
        out of any change we have made to GovSite, we will make reasonable efforts
        to fix the reported problem.

    3.  From time to time, dxw may add features to GovSite. At its sole discretion,
        any feature added to GovSite may be made available to all GovSite customers.

    4.  If you require functionality that GovSite does not include dxw may, at its
        sole discretion and for an agreed fee, create that functionality.

    5.  From time to time, dxw may deprecate GovSite features, making them
        unavailable for use. If we deprecate a feature under this clause 5.5 which
        materially impacts your use of GovSite, we will make every reasonable effort
        (other than reinstating the feature) to accommodate your requirements. If
        we cannot do so, you may terminate this contract without penalty and we will
        make every reasonable effort to assist your migration to an alternative
        service.

    6.  We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change which may have an
        impact upon your use of GovSite.

6. ### Support

    1.  At any time, you may create a Support Ticket.

    2.  dxw will make reasonable efforts to respond to Support Tickets
        within the period of time specified in our Service Level Agreement,
        which forms part of this contract.

    3.  All contact regarding the services dxw provides as part of this
        contract must be made via Support Tickets.

    4.  You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
        Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
        consequent failure on our part to respond to you or take or not take
        some action will not be a breach of this contract.

    5.  At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
        are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
        emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.

    6.  If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
        not meet the criteria for an emergency, dxw may withdraw your
        ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.

    7.  You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
        do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
        may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
        for a prolonged period as a result.

7. ### Suspension

    1.  dxw may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:

        1.  You fail to pay invoices whose total value is greater than or equal
            to our total fee for the preceeding two months' usage of GovSite;
        2.  As a last resort, if we believe that it is necessary for us to do so in order to
            protect your data or another GovSite user's information security,
            or to protect other users of the internet.

    2.  In the event that the services are suspended, dxw will replace your
        website with a message stating that your website is down for maintenance.

8. ### Termination

    1.  This contract is subject to a minimum term of 12 months from the date it
        is agreed.

    2.  You may terminate this contract at any time by giving us 30 days' notice
        in writing.

    3.  If you terminate this contract earlier than 12 months from the date
        it was agreed, you agree to immediately pay a fee equal to the
        fee for 12 months usage of GovSite, less the amount you have already
        paid.

    4.  At the end of this contract, dxw will issue a final invoice for
        your usage of GovSite up to the date of termination.

9. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to resolve Support Tickets, there may be materials ("Required Materials") that dxw requires in order to resolve the ticket either because it is reasonably apparent that they will be required or because dxw has informed you that they will be required.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical after becoming aware that they are Required Materials.
    3.  If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
        Materials, dxw will suspend work on that ticket.

        standard.

        Â£1,000,000 (the "insured sum").

        reasonably practical.

        that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any
        failure of GovSite.

        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. dxw can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
