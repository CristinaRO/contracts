<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<p>Are we correct to use “A or B” constructions or will those be interpreted as “A xor B”? Where the former is our intent should we say “A and/or B”</p>

<p>Are we a data processor under GDPR? If so: add a clause saying “This is a data processing agreement”, and make sure we cover:</p>

<p>The Processor must have adequate information security in place; <br />
The Processor must not use sub Processors without consent of the Controller;  <br />
The Processor must cooperate with the relevant Data Protection Authorities in the event of an enquiry;  <br />
The Processor must report data breaches to the Controller without delay;  <br />

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the Goals are changed during the work, dxw cyber may provide a new order summary. Our agreement to the

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any change to dxw cyber’s fees during the Work will be limited to those necessary for us to commit the time
and skills that we require in order to be able to achieve the changed Goals.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The order summary is not a specification nor a commitment to produce specific deliverables. It is a commitment<br />
to provide the Team for a defined amount of time.</p>

    <h3 id="scope-of-work">Scope of work</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Prior to the commencement of any practical security testing that may form part of the Work, the parties must
agree in writing to a scope for the Work (the “scope”).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The scope will detail the Hosts against which dxw cyber is authorised to perform practical security
testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>During the Work, either party may request amendments to the scope.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Both parties acknowledge that the prompt agreement to changes in the scope necessary for the Goals to be
met and that unnecessary restrictions to the Scope increase the risk that the Goals will not be achieved.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="consent-to-practical-security-testing">Consent to practical security testing</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw cyber may, where the necessary acts are lawful without your consent, carry out practical security testing,
research and analysis relating to information or programs from, on or about any of your Hosts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw cyber will not perform any practical security testing that would otherwise be unlawful without an your
consent in the form of an agreed scope of work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Given an agreed scope containing a list of Hosts (“the hosts”), you authorise dxw cyber to:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Access or modify programs and data on the hosts;</li>
          <li>Perform actions on the hosts which may impair their operation, prevent or hinder access by other users, or
impair the operation of programs that run on them;</li>
          <li>Intercept or modify communications to and from the hosts or between any other hosts on a network to which
one of the hosts is connected;</li>
          <li>Make false or misleading representations to your employees, and you acknowledge and agree that the sole
intent of these statements is to make assessments of your security;</li>
          <li>Access and process personal data on the hosts, and you confirm that you have a lawful basis under the General
Data Protection Regulations to retain and process all personal data that you hold.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>At the conclusion of testing, dxw cyber will, as far as is reasonably practical, ensure each Host subjected to
testing is restored to a state substantially similar to that in which we found it at the start of testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Following the end of testing, dxw cyber will destroy all data obtained from Hosts during testing, with the

          <li>Hashed passwords;</li>

        <p>dxw cyber will take all reasonably practical steps to protect and prevent the disclosure of client data.</p>
