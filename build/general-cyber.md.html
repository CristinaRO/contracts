      <li>
        <p>Before starting a Project, dxw cyber will provide an order summary.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The order summary dxw cyber provides will contain:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The initial project goals;</li>

      <li>
        <p>The initial Project goals will represent our best understanding of the work that you require to be completed as
     part of the Project, at the time it was written.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>At any time during a Project if the goals that your project is addressing change substantially, you must notify
us, and new goals must be agreed in writing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the goals are changed during the Project, dxw cyber may provide a new order summary. Our agreement to the
updated goals will be contingent on your accepting of any associated change in fees.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any change to dxw cyber’s fees during a Project will be limited to those necessary for us to commit the time
and skills that we require in order to be able to achieve the changed goals.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The order summary is not a specification nor a commitment to produce specific deliverables, other than the
provision of activities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw cyber cannot guarantee that the goals of any particular Project will be achieved.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <li>
    <h3 id="scope-of-work">Scope of work</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Prior to the commencement of any practical security testing that may form part of the Project, the parties must
agree in writing to a scope of work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The scope of work will detail the Hosts against which dxw cyber is authorised to perform practical security
testing work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>During the Project, either party may request amendments to the scope of work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Both parties acknowledge that the prompt agreement to scope changes is necessary for the Project goals to be
met and that unnecessary restrictions to the scope of work increase the risk that the Project goals will not be
achieved.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="consent-to-practical-security-testing">Consent to practical security testing</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw cyber may, where the necessary acts are lawful without your consent, carry out security testing, research
and analysis relating to any of your Hosts available via the public internet.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw cyber will not perform any practical security testing work that would otherwise be unlawful without an your
consent in the form of an agreed scope of work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Given an agreed scope of work containing a list of Hosts (“the hosts”), you authorise dxw cyber to:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Access and modify programs and data on the hosts;</li>
          <li>Perform actions on the hosts which may impair their operation, prevent or hinder access by other users, or
impair the operation of programs that run on them;</li>
          <li>Intercept and modify communications to and from the hosts or between any other hosts on a network to which
one of the hosts is connected;</li>
          <li>Make false or misleading representations to your employees, and you acknowledge and agree that the sole
intent of these statements is to make assessments of your security.</li>
          <li>Access and process personal data on the hosts, and you confirm that you have a lawful basis under the General
Data Protection Regulations to retain and process all personal data that you hold.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>At the conclusion of testing, dxw cyber will, as far as is reasonably practical, ensure each Host subjected to
testing is restored to a state substantially similar to that in which we found it at the start of testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Following the end of testing, dxw cyber will destroy all data obtained from Hosts during testing, with the#
