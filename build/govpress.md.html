    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>You agree that occasional unavailability of your website is not
something that can reasonably be avoided.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Nonetheless, dxw will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
your website is accessible over the internet 100% of the time, excluding
periods of planned maintenance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

        <p>Clause 5.3 shall not apply if the unavailability is a result of events that
are beyond dxw’s control.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From time to time, we may need to make your website unavailable in order to
carry out essential maintenance. dxw will make every reasonable effort to
give you as much notice as possible when planned unavailability will occur,
and will complete such work outside the hours of 09:00-18:00 Monday-Friday
whenever it is reasonably possible.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="enhancement-of-the-service">Enhancement of the service</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw may at any time make changes to GovPress without giving
notice. We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change
which may have an impact upon your use of GovPress.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw will not make any changes that remove or materially impair the
supply of the services described in clauses 4.1 and 4.2 of this contract.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Changes made by dxw under this clause 5 will normally have no detectable
effect on the operation of your website. If you make a reasonable request
to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
out of any change we have made to GovPress, we will make reasonable efforts
to fix the reported problem.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="support">Support</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>At any time, you may create a Support Ticket.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw will make reasonable efforts to respond to Support Tickets
within the period of time specified in our Service Level Agreement,
which forms part of this contract.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All contact regarding the services dxw provides as part of this
contract must be made via Support Tickets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
consequent failure on our part to respond to you or take or not take
some action will not be a breach of this contract.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
not meet the criteria for an emergency, dxw may withdraw your
ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
for a prolonged period as a result.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="time-allowance">Time allowance</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw’s initial fee for Fully Managed support is calculated from the
Time Allowance, which is based on our assessment of your website’s
likely support requirements, as stated in the proposal.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw will track time spent providing the services specified in this
contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
of the time required to service your website in any given month.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, dxw will carry out all of the services provided
under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
Allowance has not been exceeded.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, if dxw chooses to complete work in excess of the
Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
completed at dxw’s absolute discretion and the fact that dxw does so on
one occasion will not imply that dxw will do so on subsequent occasions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, if dxw chooses not to complete work in excess of
the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and, subject to our availability,
will complete that work if dxw’s fees for the additional work are paid.
dxw will not complete any such work without your authorisation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
change to dxw’s fees.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this agreement
to a professional standard.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If your Time Allowance is reguarly exceeded, or almost exceeded, dxw
may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
Allowance be increased.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, dxw may require
you to reduce the workload that your website generates; for example, by
submitting fewer Support Tickets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance is calculated per month. Unusused time is not carried
over and may not be used in any subsequent month.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
to managing your website that could reduce your operational costs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance will have no bearing on dxw’s provision of the
services detailed in clauses 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.1.4.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

    <h3 id="installation-of-plugins">Installation of plugins</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The terms in this section only apply to you if your website is Fully
Managed, or if your Partly Managed service includes WordPress plugin
updates or installation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>At any time, you may create a Support Ticket to ask us to install a
plugin on your website.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you ask dxw to install a plugin, we will conduct an assessment of
that plugin intended to give a broad understanding of the kinds of
security problems that plugin may have.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Based on dxw’s assessment of a plugin, dxw may refuse to install that
plugin or updates for that plugin.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Plugin security assessments are intended only to give a broad
understanding of a plugin’s security status. The results are opinions
only. dxw neither offers any guarantee that a plugin whose assessment
produced positive results does not contain security vulnerabilities,
nor that negative results necessarily imply that a plugin does contain
security vulnerabilities.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="suspension">Suspension</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>You fail to pay invoices whose total value is greater than or equal
to our total fee for the preceeding two months’ usage of GovPress;</li>
          <li>As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
protect your data or another GovPress user’s information
security, or to protect other users of the internet.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the event that the services are suspended, dxw will replace your
website with a message stating that your website is down for maintenance.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>In order to resolve Support Tickets, there will occasionally be
Required Materials that you must provide.</li>
      <li>You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
practical.</li>
      <li>If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
Materials, we will suspend work on that ticket.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="quality">Quality</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>dxw will deliver work of a professional standard.</li>
      <li>dxw is insured against professional negligence to a value of
£1,000,000 (the “insured sum”). dxw would be willing to negotiate
an increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to
pass on any corresponding increase in the premium.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of liability</h3>

    <ol>

      <li>dxw will deliver work that is as robust and reliable as is
reasonably practical.</li>
      <li>You acknowledge that all software of non-trivial size contains bugs,
including security vulnerabilities, and that it is not
reasonably practical to deliver bug-free software.</li>
      <li>dxw will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation
that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any
failure of the Product.</li>
      <li>You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
any such failure. dxw can work with you to design or implement
such measures at your request for an agreed fee.</li>
      <li>Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.</li>
      <li>
        <p>In any event, dxw’s total liability under this agreement is
limited to the lesser of:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The total cost of the Project.</li>
          <li>The insured sum.</li>
        </ol>

          <li>The content or existence of any document you send to us that
