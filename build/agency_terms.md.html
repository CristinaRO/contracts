    <h3 id="parties">Parties</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>This agreement is between The Dextrous Web Ltd, a company
registered in England and Wales under number 6617101, trading as

    <h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>Sprint</dt>
      <dd>A Sprint is our basic unit of development. A sprint consists of
the services of a given number of developers for a given period
of time, and any Surrounding Activities you require.</dd>
      <dt>Acceptance Criteria</dt>
      <dd>Acceptance Criteria document attributes of the Product which a
Story must provide in order for the Story to be considered
Finished.</dd>
      <dt>Backlog</dt>
      <dd>The Backlog is a prioritised list of Stories for implementation
by developers.</dd>
      <dt>Finished</dt>
      <dd>A Story is Finished when its Acceptance Criteria have been met.</dd>
      <dt>Product</dt>
      <dd>The collection of software and services which, when operational,
will meet the goals specified in your Product Description.</dd>
      <dt>Product Description</dt>
      <dd>A Product Description is a written explanation of your Project’s
goals and the nature of the functionality that you expect will
be required to achieve those goals.</dd>
      <dt>Project</dt>
      <dd>A Project is a sequence of Sprints used to develop features a
Product.</dd>
      <dt>Reject</dt>
      <dd>A Rejected story is one which, following its implementation, you
do not believe has been Finished.</dd>
      <dt>Required Materials</dt>
      <dd>Required Materials are things that dxw needs in order to
complete a particular piece of work, including but not limited
to images, text content, licences, consents, or clear
instructions.</dd>
      <dt>Sprints Estimate</dt>
      <dd>The number of Sprints dxw estimates will be required to deliver
a Product, as specified in the Product Description. Generally
expressed as a range; for example: “Between X and Y sprints”.
These numbers are estimates, and are not binding.</dd>
      <dt>Started</dt>
      <dd>A Story has been Started when a developer has begun its
implementation.</dd>
      <dt>Story</dt>
      <dd>A Story is a description of some work to be completed. In order
for Story to be considered complete, it must specify a user
need, identify the user who has the need, and describe some
behaviour that (having been implemented) will meet that need.</dd>
      <dt>Surrounding Activities</dt>
      <dd>Surrounding Activities are services dxw provides as part of the
Project but are not part of a Sprint; for example user testing
and discovery, penetration testing, research or business
analysis.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="proposal">Proposal</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Before starting a Project, dxw will provide a proposal.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The proposal dxw provides will:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Describe the nature of your Project and its goals as dxw
understands them and the general nature of the functionality
that you require (the Product Description);</li>
          <li>A recommendation for the duration of a Sprint, its
Surrounding Activities and a number of developers;</li>
          <li>Our fees, based on the recommended Sprint;</li>
          <li>An indication of when dxw is available to start the work and
a Sprints Estimate;</li>
          <li>Any other information that we have agreed must be recorded
and agreed prior to the commencement of the Project.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The Project Description dxw provides will represent our best
understanding of the work that you require to be completed as
part of the Project, at the time it was written.</li>
      <li>At any time during a Project if the Project Description changes
substantially, you must tell us, and a new Project Description
must be agreed in writing.</li>
      <li>If the Product Description is amended during the Project, the
Sprints Estimate must also be amended. If it is not, the Sprints
Estimate originally provided in the proposal will apply.</li>
      <li>Neither the Project Description nor the proposal is a
specification and neither commit us to providing any particular
features or deliverables, other than the provision of Sprints.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="sprints">Sprints</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>dxw will deliver a number of Sprints in order to create a
Product.</li>
      <li>Initially, dxw will deliver Sprints with the structure agreed in
the proposal.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may request that the length of the Sprint or
the number of developers be changed. Subject to our available
resources, dxw will accommodate such requests.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of the Project, dxw will work with you to
define an initial set of Stories for implementation. This list
of Stories form the Project’s Backlog.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of each Sprint, dxw will work with you to
prioritise the Stories in the Backlog and agree Acceptance
Criteria.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may add Stories to the Backlog.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may change the priority of Stories in the
Backlog.</li>
      <li>During each Sprint, dxw will implement Stories, starting with
the most important Story in the Backlog.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of each Sprint, dxw will give an indication of
the number of Stories dxw expects to be able to complete during
the Sprint. This indication is not binding. The number of
Stories completed in each Sprint will vary.</li>
      <li>
        <p>A Story cannot be Started unless:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>It is complete;</li>
          <li>It has agreed Acceptance Criteria;</li>
          <li>All Required Materials for the Story’s implementation have
been provided to us</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After a Story has been Started:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>You may not change the Story without dxw’s prior consent;</li>
          <li>You may instruct us to cease work on the Story;</li>
          <li>dxw will make every reasonable effort to complete the Story
within the Sprint.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After a Story has been Finished:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>dxw will make it available to you for your testing and
review;</li>
          <li>You must Accept the story as soon as you are reasonably able
to do so, and in any case, no later than the end of the
Sprint;</li>
          <li>You must not Reject the Story unless it has not met its
Acceptance Criteria;</li>
          <li>If you Reject a Story, it will be returned to the Backlog
for inclusion in a future Sprint;</li>
          <li>If having tested the Story’s implementation you decide that
its functionality should be materially different from the
Acceptance Criteria, you must make a new Story describing
the changes you require, and new Acceptance Criteria must be
agreed.</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>If you accept our proposal, dxw will provide an order summary

its structure;</li>
          <li>The start and end dates of all Sprints that you have told us

would like us to undertake, and their associated costs;</li>
          <li>Contact details for members of dxw’s staff who you may need
to contact, including an escalation contact.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>At any time, you may request further Sprints. Subject to our
availability, dxw will make every reasonable effort to schedule
Sprints at a time that is convenient to you.</li>
      <li>Whenever further Sprints are requested, dxw will provide an
additional order summary.</li>
      <li>Upon your acceptance of an order summary, the specified Sprints
will be booked.</li>
      <li>If you cancel a Sprint which has been booked, a cancellation fee
will immediately become payable. The cancellation fee is 35% of
the cost of the Sprint.</li>
      <li>If the upper value in the Sprints Estimate is met and the
Product falls materially short of the standard specified in the
original Product Description (“Unacceptable”), dxw will discount
the cost of further sprints by 35%.</li>
      <li>As soon as the Product is no longer Unacceptable, no further
discounts will apply.</li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw reserves the right not to provide discounted Sprints if:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The Product is Unacceptable primarily due to your
negligence, poor project management, unresponsiveness,
failure to provide Required Materials or failure to
understand or describe your requirements;</li>
          <li>You have breached the terms of this agreement.</li>

Backlog. This may cause a Story not to be delivered in the
Sprint you have specified.</li>
