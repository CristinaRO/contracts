## Questions

* We vs Us vs The Company
* Are there other general duties?
* "Staff handbook" should be recast as something which pulls specified bits of the playbook into the ambit of the contract. What should it be called?
* Holiday practicalities
    * Have a script which checks Forecast for work 28 days in the future and prompts people to book holiday if they want it
    * Or an email with a link to confirm that they aren't taking any?
    * Or just require 28 days notice and keep it manual?
    * Or publish holiday somewhere and alert clients or DMs automatically to absences?
    * Or push Breathe holiday into Forecast and then create some way for clients to see their project in Forecast?

## Changes so far

* Additional rights for dxw to make deductions from pay, permitting loan repayments, recovering expenses paid in error and recovering costs incurred due to negligence or dishonesty
* Commission scheme removed, as it is not used
* Probationary period increased to four months, with an option to extend for a further two
* Notice period increased for staff who have been here for more than two years
* Pension scheme added
* Employee right to claim expenses added
* Parental leave added
* Sick pay added
* Obligation to report and abstain from offering inappropriate gratuities
* General duty to abide by dxw's values
* Holiday notice periods normalised to 7 days for a day off and 28 days for anything longer

      <li>You will be paid pro rata as follows: the number of days you have worked each month will be divided by the number of weekdays (Monday to Friday) in the same month, the resulting fraction will be multiplied by one twelfth of the equivalent full time annual salary to give the amount of pay you are entitled to in that month.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="fixed-part-time-staff">Fixed part-time staff</h3>
    <ol>

      <li>You will be paid pro rata as follows: the number of days you work each week will be divided by five, the resulting fraction will be multiplied by one twelfth of the equivalent full time annual salary to give the amount of pay you are entitled to each month.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="probationary-period">Probationary period</h3>

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="notice-period">Notice period</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In cases of gross misconduct, you may be dismissed with no notice.</li>
      <li>Other than in cases of gross misconduct, your notice period:

          <li>following your probationary period up to the second anniversary of your commencement date is six weeks;</li>

      <li>These periods apply to both you and the company, irrespective of who is giving notice to whom.</li>
      <li>Notice to quit will only be effective if given in writing, which includes by e-mail.</li>
      <li>Once notice has been given (whether from you to us, or from us to you), we reserve the right, at any time after the notice was given while you are still employed with us, to give you pay in lieu of notice. This means that we will pay you as a lump sum, the salary that would otherwise be payable to you during the unexpired portion of your notice period.</li>

    <h3 id="holiday-entitlement">Holiday entitlement</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>We operate a holiday year which runs from 1st July to 30th June in the following year.</li>
      <li>Leave accrues throughout the year according to the formula given below, resulting in 33 days paid leave for full time staff and a pro rata proportion for those working part time.</li>
      <li>Unless notified otherwise you will be required to take all Bank Holidays and Public Holidays as leave and those days are counted in the total of 33 days.</li>
      <li>You may carry over a maximum of 5 days’ leave from one holiday year to the next.</li>
      <li>At any time in a leave year, your accrued leave entitlement may be calculated as follows: 2.08 x Number of days worked in the year to date / 21.75</li>
      <li>The amount of leave you may take will be the total leave accrued, rounded up to the nearest half a day, minus any leave you have already taken in the leave year.</li>
      <li>We will usually permit you to take up to 5 days leave in advance of it being accrued.</li>
      <li>If you wish to take leave, you must obtain approval (which will not be unreasonably withheld) and give notice of:
        <ol>
          <li>28 days for a period of leave longer than 1 day;</li>
          <li>7 days for a period of 1 day or less.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>When your employment ends, you will receive payment in lieu for any part of your leave entitlement which has accrued but which has not been taken. Similarly, if you have taken more leave than you have accrued, we will deduct the appropriate amount of pay from any payment due from us to you on the termination of your employment or, if this is insufficient, we will require you to make up any shortfall.</li>
